# AI DDI Predictor (AIDoctors)

## 📋 Overview

AI DDI Predictor (AIDoctors) is an AI-powered drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction system designed to help healthcare professionals identify potential adverse drug interactions. The platform leverages machine learning models trained on real-world clinical data to provide risk assessments when prescribing multiple medications.

### Key Features

- **DDI Risk Prediction**: Analyze potential interactions between current and newly prescribed medications
- **Patient Context Analysis**: Predictions consider patient demographics, comorbidities, and medication history compared to historical cases
- **Real-time Alerts**: Receive immediate feedback on high-risk drug combinations
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Evidence-based recommendations to support safer prescribing practices

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python, PostgreSQL
- **ML Pipeline**: Custom fine-tuned models on FAERS and Synthea datasets
- **Infrastructure**: AWS (ECS Fargate, RDS, ALB, S3, EventBridge)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Terraform

### Architecture

The application consists of three main components:

1. **Web Application** (Frontend + Backend API)

   - User authentication and session management
   - Interactive prediction interface
   - RESTful API for DDI predictions

2. **Data Extraction Pipeline**

   - Automated extraction from FAERS database
   - Scheduled via EventBridge (weekly)
   - Processes adverse event reports

3. **ML Training Pipeline**
   - Model fine-tuning on combined datasets
   - Scheduled via EventBridge (weekly, 30min after extraction)
   - Continuous model improvement

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UofT-CSC490-F2025/AIDoctors.git
   cd AIDoctors
   ```

2. **Set up the application**
   - **Frontend**: See [Frontend README](src/application/frontend/README.md) for instructions on installing dependencies and running the Next.js application
   - **Backend**: See [Backend README](src/application/backend/README.md) for instructions on setting up the FastAPI server and database

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.9.0+ (for frontend)
- Python 3.11+ (for backend)
- PostgreSQL (for database)
- Docker (optional, for containerized development)
- AWS Credentials (for Bedrock API access)
